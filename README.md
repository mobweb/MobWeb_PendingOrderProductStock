# MobWeb_PendingOrderProductStock extension for Magento

This extension adds a new field to the product's "Inventory" tab in the admin panel. This field displays the total quantity of units of this product from orders that haven't been completed yet. So for example if this value is 4, it means that four units have been ordered but these orders aren't completed yet. The idea behind this is that the inventory manager always knows exactly how many units they should have in stock. For example if a product has been ordered but not yet shipped, the "Qty" field is not the same as the quantity of actual units in stock.

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible.
